# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The Tour of Heroes application that I build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features I do expect to find in any data-driven application. The finished application acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.
